## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to analyze SmartMart's sales transactions using statistical techniques and data visualization. By uncovering meaningful insights from the sales data, SmartMart can make informed decisions to enhance its overall performance and profitability.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains information on SmartMart's sales transactions, including:
- Date and time of each transaction
- Customer ID
- Product ID
- Quantity sold
- Unit price
- Total transaction amount
- Store ID

## Analysis Techniques
The project employs various data analysis techniques to derive insights from the sales data:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques are used to summarize and understand the central tendency, dispersion, and distribution of key variables.
2. **Correlation Analysis**: The relationships between numerical variables are examined using correlation analysis, and a heatmap is generated to identify potential factors influencing sales.
3. **Hypothesis Testing**: Statistical hypothesis testing is conducted to compare the total transaction amounts between different stores and identify variations in store performance.
4. **Time-Series Analysis**: The project explores the trends and seasonality in sales data by analyzing monthly total transaction amounts and visualizing the trend using a line plot.

## Key Findings and Recommendations
The analysis reveals significant correlations between certain numerical variables, variations in total transaction amounts between different stores, and trends and seasonality in monthly sales. Based on these findings, the project provides recommendations to enhance SmartMart's operations and profitability, such as conducting further investigations into factors affecting store performance, leveraging demand forecasting models, exploring customer segmentation techniques, and monitoring pricing strategies.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains the sales transaction dataset used for the analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Includes Jupyter notebooks with the code and detailed explanations of the analysis performed.
- `visualizations/`: Contains generated visualizations, such as histograms, correlation heatmaps, box plots, and line plots.
- `reports/`: Includes the final report summarizing the findings, insights, and recommendations.
